To effectively reduce HIV transmission and HIV-related morbidity and mortality, accurate data are required to guide public health decision-making.  HIV/AIDS surveillance data are used to guide the allocation of millions of dollars in federal, state and city resources targeted for HIV prevention as well as treatment and support services for HIV-infected persons.  New York City prevention, treatment and care resource allocation recommendations are developed by two planning bodies composed of representatives of government agencies, non-governmental experts, patient representatives and advocates, and community-based organizations.  The HIV Epidemiology and Field Services Program, which maintains the HIV/AIDS Registry and monitors the epidemic in New York City, provides data, reports, interpretation and counsel to these planning bodies.   The federal prevention portfolio is allocated by the HIV Prevention Planning Group (HPG), and the federal treatment and care portfolio is allocated by the Ryan White Planning Council (RWPC).   Each group has a community and government co-chair and members representing governmental and non-governmental agencies and interests.    The HIV Epidemiology and Field Services Program is recruiting a senior scientist to serve as its Epidemiologic Liaison to these planning groups.  The individual will report to the programâ€™s Deputy Director and will work closely with the HIV Surveillance Unit and Research Unit to manage the provision of timely and useful reports and presentations to the planning bodies and their various special-issue committees.  The Epidemiologic Liaison will also work closely with personnel in the Bureau of HIV Prevention and Control who manage the federal grants and the planning bodies, the Director of Community Planning and the Director of Care and Treatment Services, as well as with the government co-chairs of the PPG and RWPC.  Responsibilities include ensuring that expressed needs for data and interpretation, including reports and oral presentations, are met (and anticipated), and that the two planning bodies have the support they require for adequate interpretation of the data and data-driven allocation of their grant dollars.  The position requires epidemiologic expertise, knowledge of and experience in using and analyzing NYCâ€™s surveillance registry, skill in writing and public speaking, and expert management of questions and concerns about the meaning of data from persons of varying backgrounds.    Wisdom and perspective on the history of the AIDS epidemic in NYC is needed to interpret current trends, as is knowledge of state-of-the-art prevention science and HIV treatment and care guidelines.

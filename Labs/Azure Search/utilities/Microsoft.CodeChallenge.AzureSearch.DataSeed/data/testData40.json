We deliver 1.1 billion gallons of high quality drinking water per day to 8.3 million New York City residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York and we collect and treat an average of 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day.    The NYC DEP Stream Management Program (SMP) seeks a professional project manager to coordinate the implementation of stream and flood plain management strategies with municipalities in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed.

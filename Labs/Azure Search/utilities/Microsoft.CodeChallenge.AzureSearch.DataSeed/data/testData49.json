In NYC, it is estimated that more than 60,000 residential units were damaged by Hurricane Sandy.  New York City's Build it Back Program provides reconstruction, rehabilitation, and reimbursement assistance to all Build it Back-registered residential buildings impacted by Hurricane Sandy, from single family homes to high-density multifamily housing, as well as rental assistance to displaced low-income tenants. The Federal government has allocated $4.22 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds to the City, of which $2.34 billion has been allocated for housing recovery. The Multifamily Storm Recovery  Program provides CDBG-DR funds to reimburse owners for completed repairs, repair any remaining Sandy damage, and complete resiliency improvements on targeted developments.  The Multifamily Storm Recovery Program includes a broad group of more than 500 projects, which include rental buildings, condominium developments, and cooperatives that were damaged by Sandy. Projects range in size from individual condo/coop units to developments with 5 to 1,500 or more units.    HPD has also partnered with three Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) as sub-grantees/recipients to provide funds to the affected buildings: the Community Preservation Corporation (CPC), the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and the New York City Housing Development Corporation (NYC HDC).    As part of the Program, staff conduct project management, create budgets, assist with creation and execution of legal documents, seek necessary permits and approvals, and play a central role on moving applicants through the entire assistance process. Program staff work with other City, State and Federal agencies, including the Cityâ€™s Office of Housing Recovery Operations (HRO), Department of Buildings (DOB), the Office of Recovery and Resiliency (ORR), and U.S. Office of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to ensure compliance with City, State and Federal regulations prior to funding. During construction, HPD will monitor projects to ensure quality assurance, compliance with all regulatory requirements including Davis Bacon prevailing wage requirements (where applicable), and timely construction in accordance with schedules and expectations.     Under the supervision of the Director of the Multifamily Storm Recovery Program, the project manager will be responsible for managing individual projects from predevelopment to the closing on financing and the completion of construction. The project manager may also be asked to assist with key programmatic functions, including policy development, process flow and operations, analytical review, and communications.    The project manager will be responsible for managing the intake, assessment, and budget review of projects receiving CDBG-DR funds, ensuring that all due diligence is met in advance of loan closings, and track regulatory compliance during construction.  This will entail coordination with the applicant, the programâ€™s external partners/contractors and HPDâ€™s internal divisions, such as Legal, Construction Monitoring, Scoping, Cost Estimating, Labor Monitoring, and Budget. The project manager will also review and track individual project budgets from initial estimates to final budget at closing.

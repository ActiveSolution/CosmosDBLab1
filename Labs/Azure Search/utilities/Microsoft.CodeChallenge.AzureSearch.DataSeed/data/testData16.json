DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country with nearly 6,000 employees. We deliver 1.1 billion gallons of high quality drinking water per day to 8.3 million New York City residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York and we collect and treat an average of 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day.    The NYC DEP Stream Management Program (SMP) seeks a professional project manager to coordinate the implementation of stream and flood plain management strategies with municipalities in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed.    Since 1997, the DEP SMP has worked closely with municipal governments throughout the Catskill Mountain region to develop and implement stream management plans, projects and programs that advance the sound management of streams, floodplains and riparian corridors. The Program takes an ecosystem management approach towards the Cityâ€™s primary objective of protection and/or enhancement of water quality because this approach also enables achievement of NYC Watershed community goals such as flood hazard mitigation, protection of infrastructure and property and the restoration and conservation of aquatic and riparian habitats.     The Ashokan Watershed is one of the four reservoir basin-scale Stream Management Program teams that are coordinated by the NYC DEP together with four County Soil and Water Conservation Districts and Cornell Cooperative Extension of Ulster County.

To reduce HIV transmission and HIV-related morbidity and mortality, accurate case surveillance data are required to guide public health decision-making and to allocate resources for HIV prevention and treatment and support services for HIV-infected persons.  Surveillance data are primarily generated through legally mandated population-based HIV surveillance. The HIV Epidemiology and Field Services Program of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene processes >6,000 provider  and 800,000 laboratory reports annually, generating more than 12,000 field investigations, 2500 new diagnoses of HIV and 2,000 new diagnoses of AIDS each year.  In addition to standard case surveillance, the program conducts two important supplemental surveillance activities â€“ incidence and resistance surveillance.  Incidence surveillance uses a CDC statistical algorithm coupled with a laboratory test that can distinguish between early and chronic infection to estimate HIV incidence, thereby assisting the agency to track the numbers and characteristics of persons who are becoming infected now and permitting the targeting of prevention resources to hyperendemic populations. Resistance surveillance uses legally mandated nucleotide sequence reporting to track the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed persons and acquired resistance among those with established infections.    The program seeks a City Research Scientist I to assist the HIV Incidence and Resistance team with data management and analysis, estimation of incident infection (vs. incident diagnosis) and estimation of transmitted drug resistance.  This entry-level position provides a unique opportunity to learn the basic principles and complexities of HIV incidence and resistance surveillance and to work under the guidance of persons with experience and expertise.  The individual should have sufficient background in epidemiology, biology and viral genetics to grasp and apply the training and guidance that he or she will receive regarding the genetic structure of HIV, the science of reverse transcription, reproduction and integration of HIV into the host genome, the laboratory methods used to detect genetically mediated resistance, and the various statistical and laboratory methods used to estimate HIV incidence.

The individual will:    1.\tAssist the project coordinator with outreach  to the New York State Department of Health on issues regarding the regular transmission and format of encrypted genotype data through the NYS Health Commerce system (HCS).  2.\tAssist the project coordinator with outreach to laboratories on regular ongoing submission of remnant specimens to NYC.  3.\tAssist the project coordinator with liaison activities to NYS Wadsworth Laboratory on directly submitted and cross-jurisdictional incidence specimens.  4.\tAssist in the  implementation, evaluation and monitoring, and modification, if needed, of new CDC incidence and resistance management systems.   5.\tAssist with managing, cleaning, and verification of  incoming data files, including monitoring quality and completeness.  6.\tLearn to match incidence and genotype data to case records in registry and its multiple feeder databases.   7.\tLearn to monitor","minimum_qual_requirements":"1.

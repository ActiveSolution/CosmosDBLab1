To reduce HIV transmission and HIV-related morbidity and mortality, accurate case surveillance data are required to guide public health decision-making and to allocate resources for HIV prevention and treatment and support services for HIV-infected persons.  Surveillance data are primarily generated through legally mandated population-based HIV surveillance. The HIV Epidemiology and Field Services Program of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene processes >6,000 provider  and 800,000 laboratory reports annually, generating more than 12,000 field investigations, 2500 new diagnoses of HIV and 2,000 new diagnoses of AIDS each year.  In addition to standard case surveillance, the program conducts two important supplemental surveillance activities â€“ incidence and resistance surveillance.  Incidence surveillance uses a CDC statistical algorithm coupled with a laboratory test that can distinguish between early and chronic infection to estimate HIV incidence, thereby assisting the agency to track the numbers and characteristics of persons who are becoming infected now and permitting the targeting of prevention resources to hyperendemic populations. Resistance surveillance uses legally mandated nucleotide sequence reporting to track the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed persons and acquired resistance among those with established infections.

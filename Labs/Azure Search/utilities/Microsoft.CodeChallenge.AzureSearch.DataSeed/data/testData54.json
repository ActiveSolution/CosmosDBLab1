The Bureau of Water Supply seeks to hire a City Research Scientist (CRS) II within the Division of Water Quality Science and Research (WQSR) to be located in the Bureauâ€™s Kingston, New York offices. The focus of this position will be to contribute to new research initiatives by improving operation of the water supply system to 1) address increasingly stringent regulatory requirements on disinfection byproducts (DBP) and 2) employ tools that will allow WSQR to analyze high-frequency data collected by the Robotic Monitoring program. DEP seeks to enhance knowledge of dissolved organic carbon sources and dynamics in the NYC reservoir watersheds as related to DBP formation potential. This knowledge will inform DEPâ€™s water quality modeling efforts and influence operational decisions. DEP also seeks to make use of readily available computing resources to analyze high-frequency data.     Under direction of the Section Chief for Program Evaluation and Planning, with broad scope for independent initiative and judgment, the responsibilities and tasks for the City Research Scientist II in this position will involve difficult technical work as an individual contributor on two major initiatives noted above. The duties of the scientist in this position will include the following:  â€¢Will participate in research on the dynamics of organic carbon and its role in disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation in NYCâ€™s drinking water; will work closely with other scientists as they use reservoir and stream data to refine coefficients and calibrate models to simulate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and DBPs in the NYC water supply reservoirs. This is a technical project that will require knowledge of biological and chemical factors controlling production and transport of DOC and DBPs. Contribute to review of manuscripts and develop publications on this subject.  â€¢Will analyze high-frequency data derived from DEPâ€™s robotic monitoring system to elucidate sources of DBPs. Will apply software programs developed by the Global Lake Ecological Observation Network (GLEON); this requires proficiency in R software; will arrange for acquisition, set-up, applications and maintenance of updated versions of the software for; Lake Analyzer, Lake Metabolizer, General Lake Model (GLM), Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Model (FABM), and Aquatic Ecodynamics Module (AED).
